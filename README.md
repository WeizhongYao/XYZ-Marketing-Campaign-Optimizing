This is a project as part of the Business Analytics in R course during our MSBA program. In this project, we aim to help a music streaming website aliased as XYZ target the right customers in a marketing campaign and maximize the ROI. To achieve that, we adopted a cost-sensitive approach with feature selection and model selection process, and came up with a classification model that could potentially increase the profit of this campaign by 429%.

The technical details of the modelling process are available in the RMarkdown file [XYZ Campaign-Technical Document.Rmd](https://github.com/xinbo-hubert-wang/XYZ-Marketing-Campaign-Optimizing/blob/main/XYZ%20Campaign-Technical%20Document.Rmd), and [XYZ Campaign-Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/xinbo-hubert-wang/XYZ-Marketing-Campaign-Optimizing/blob/main/XYZ%20Campaign-Presentation.pptx) is a managerial presentation of the model. You can also watch our [video](https://github.com/xinbo-hubert-wang/XYZ-Marketing-Campaign-Optimizing/blob/main/XYZ%20Campaign-Video.mp4) as a presentation to the management.
